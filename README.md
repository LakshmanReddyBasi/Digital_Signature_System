# Digital_Signature_System

A simple and educational digital signature system implemented using RSA encryption in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create and verify digital signatures using RSA keys. It includes functions to generate key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures.

## Usage

### Generating RSA Keys

The Jupyter Notebook will automatically generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys) when executed.

### Signing a Message

1. Open `Digital_signature_system.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to sign a message.
3. The digital signature will be displayed in the notebook output.

### Verifying a Signature

1. Open `Digital_signature_system.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to verify a signature.
3. The notebook will indicate whether the signature is valid or invalid.

## Installation

To use this digital signature system, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install rsa
```

Running the Notebook
To run the notebook:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing Digital_signature_system.ipynb.
Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
